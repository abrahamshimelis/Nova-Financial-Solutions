# Nova-Financial-Solutions

## Business Objective 
Nova Financial Solutions aims to enhance its predictive analytics capabilities to significantly boost its financial forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency through advanced data analysis. In this project, the primary task is to conduct a rigorous analysis of the financial news dataset. The focus of the analysis is two-fold:
### Sentiment Analysis: 
Perform sentiment analysis on the ‘headline’ text to quantify the tone and sentiment expressed in financial news. This will involve using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to derive sentiment scores, which can be associated with the respective 'Stock Symbol' to understand the emotional context surrounding stock-related news.
### Correlation Analysis: 
Establish statistical correlations between the sentiment derived from news articles and the corresponding stock price movements. This involves tracking stock price changes around the date the article was published and analyzing the impact of news sentiment on stock performance. This analysis considers the publication date and potentially the time the article was published if such data can be inferred or is available.

The recommendations leverage insights from this sentiment analysis to suggest investment strategies. These strategies utilize the relationship between news sentiment and stock price fluctuations to predict future movements. The final report provide clear, actionable insights based on the analysis, offering innovative strategies to use news sentiment as a predictive tool for stock market trends.

## Dataset Overview
### Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset
FNSPID (Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset), is a comprehensive financial dataset designed to enhance stock market predictions by combining quantitative and qualitative data.

The structure of the data is as follows
    - headline: Article release headline, the title of the news article, which often includes key financial actions like stocks hitting highs, price target changes, or company earnings.
    - url: The direct link to the full news article.
    - publisher: Author/creator of article.
    - date: The publication date and time, including timezone information(UTC-4 timezone).
    - stock: Stock ticker symbol (unique series of letters assigned to a publicly traded company). For example (AAPL: Apple)

## Todo 
    - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) analysis on the following:
### Descriptive Statistics:
    - Obtain basic statistics for textual lengths (like headline length).
    - Count the number of articles per publisher to identify which publishers are most active.
    - Analyze the publication dates to see trends over time, such as increased news frequency on particular days or during specific events.
### Text Analysis(Sentiment analysis & Topic Modeling):
    - Perform sentiment analysis on headlines to gauge the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) associated with the news.
    - Use natural language processing to identify common keywords or phrases, potentially extracting topics or significant events (like "FDA approval", "price target", etc.).
## Time Series Analysis:
    - How does the publication frequency vary over time? Are there spikes in article publications related to specific market events?
    - Analysis of publishing times might reveal if there’s a specific time when most news is released, which could be crucial for traders and automated trading systems.
## Publisher Analysis:
    - Which publishers contribute most to the news feed? Is there a difference in the type of news they report?
    - If email addresses are used as publisher names, identify unique domains to see if certain organizations contribute more frequently.
